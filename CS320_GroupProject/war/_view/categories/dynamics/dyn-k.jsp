            <p class="description"><strong><u>Model Description:</u></strong> This is a demonstration of the basic principles underlying the
			behavior of rotating bodies. A cylinder “race” is used to show that the closer the
			mass of an object is concentrated to an axis of rotation, the faster it will spin
			because it has a lower moment of inertia, which is a measure of a body’s
			resistance to rotation. This demonstration should take 15-20 minutes.
             </p>
            
            <p class="principle"><strong><u>Engineering Principle:</u></strong> The mass moment of inertia is a rigid body’s resistance to
			rotation and is a measure of the distribution of mass of a rigid body relative to a
			given axis of rotation. In its most general form, the mass moment of inertia is
			given by:
			<br/>
			For a solid cylinder and a hollow cylinder, the equations for the mass moment of
			inertia about the axis of interest in the demonstration are reduced
			(http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/mi.html#mi). “M” represents
			the mass of the rigid body and “R” represents the radius of the solid cylinder,
			and “a” and “b” represent the inner and outer radii of the hollow cylinder.

            <p class="application"><strong><u>Before Class:</u></strong> Obtain the materials. Measure and calculate the basic parameters (mass, diameters). Practice the demonstration. </p>
            
            <p class="application"><strong><u>In Class:</u></strong> First establish the scenario by introducing and describing “the players”
			in your best race announcer’s voice. Then, without any analysis, ask the
			students to guess which “player” will win the competition. Ensure you record
			this on the board. Build up to the start of the race and stop just short of letting
			them go. Ask students to consider if weight might be a factor affecting the
			outcome, then provide the class with the weight of each player and see if their
			guesses change (record on the board). Again, build up to the start and stop
			short to discuss the concept of mass being a resistance to translation and
			moment of inertia as resistance to rotation. Have students help you calculate
			the moment of inertia for each of the players and take a final tally of the bets.
			Finally, let the race happen!
			Observations: The student should observe that the outcome is a factor of the
			moment of inertia and not the weight (given the overall dimensions and the
			weight of the players are approximately the same). </p><br>
            
            <p class="application"><strong><u>Additional Application:</u></strong>  Hype up the event by dramatizing the race! Consider
			using racetrack videos and noises which can easily be found on the internet. Ask
			students to guess which will win once the scenario is set up and before the
			principles are discussed. Build suspense by working your way to the “gun shot”
			starting the race, then backing off the start to analyze another aspect. If you’re
			using Power Point, incrementally build your slides to build suspense! Also,
			cylinders of different materials and diameters might be considered.
